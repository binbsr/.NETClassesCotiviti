        One of Nepal’s premier handicrafts, dhaka has earned a place in many hearts.

        The cap on the head that bestows the Nepali identity has been taken over by the Palpali Dhaka topi.  Five decades hence, Palpali Dhaka, and the topi made out of it, has enamored one and all. Additionally, interest has grown in blouses and shawls made of Palpali Dhaka, and among wealthy families, Palpali Dhaka sarees. Similarly, there is a growing trend among the younger generation men at celebratory events like marriages and bratabandhs to wear daura sulwar, waistcoat, topi, and shoes made of Palpali Dhaka, and for women to wear attractive blouses and shawls. New styles of shoulder bags and purses have also made their way into the market.

        Palpali Dhaka, which initially was made with cotton yarn, transformed itself from 2034 B.S. into a more shiny form with the use of acrylic yarn. Jaishanker Textile Industry, Khanal Textile Industry, and Nabin Textile Industry used to make Dhaka from cotton yarn, and in later days, when acrylic yarn began to be available easily, Dhaka began to be made from these. France’s Leon Josef and Marie Jacard invented the Jacard technique, which introduced big changes to the Palpali Dhaka that was once woven on handlooms by delicate hands, with great skill, enthusiasm, and effort. Dhotis, shawls, bedspreads, sarees, etc. of Palpali Dhaka began to be made with fine patterns at the edges using the Jacard technique. This technique also made it possible to produce many more meters in a day than the approximately nine inches that used to be woven on the handloom before.
