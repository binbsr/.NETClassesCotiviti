## Think of a real-world class within a proper namespace which should have:
1. Default and parameterized constructor 
2. Two auto-implemented properties
3. A read-only property evaluated from other properties
4. A write-only property
4. A constant that can be changed at compile time
4. A constant that runtime instances can modify
4. An enumeraiton list within that namespace that this class genuinely need
4. A method that returns value of two properties of point 2
