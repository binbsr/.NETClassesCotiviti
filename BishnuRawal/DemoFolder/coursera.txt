I am computer science graduate from Nepal from only university. 
Nepal is in its infancy for technical institutions and industries. Currently, 
I am working on a company which outsource products to US on healthcare business, 
with minimum financial benefits for me. Besides, I don't have international credit 
card even if I manage to pay smaller course fees. While graduation, I have studied AI, 
statistics and neural network courses and implemented some apps like email spam filtering 
using ANN algorithms. I really want to expand my knowledge on those areas of 
implementation with practical gurus like Andrew Ng. I am big fan of him for what he 
has achieved and contributed so far from Baidu to Stanford. As, machine learning is 
going to be the must-know domain for software engineers no matter what they do: mobile, 
web, desktop, data etc, I want to grasp all the foundational theories on the same to be a better engineer.


I love to experiment with machine learning algorithms. To enhance my foundation on practical 
machine learning algorithms and architectures, I would like to take this course by Andrew Ng. 
I want to broaden my engineering expertise so that I can understand and implement state of art ML 
techniques if need be. There is no denial that AI is the future and It already has big impacts on 
healthcare analytics, education, infrastructure development etc., forcing us to experience it’s need. 
Technology giants like Google, Microsoft, IBM etc. are investing and researching a lot on this domain 
and we as a software engineers must be in sync with all AI frameworks/libraries they release and should 
know the internal details of how algorithms work to rightfully integrate into our systems. I am hopeful that, 
this course will strengthen me on ML practices and use cases and nurture my career path as a full stack engineer.
